Here's a recipe recommended by ChatGPT for a refreshing cocktail called "The Mojito":

Classic Mojito

Ingredients:
- 2 oz white rum
- 1 oz fresh lime juice
- 2 teaspoons granulated sugar
- 6-8 fresh mint leaves
- Club soda (to top)
- Lime wedge and mint sprig for garnish
- Crushed ice

Instructions:
1. Muddle the mint: In a glass, gently muddle the mint leaves and sugar together until the leaves release their aroma.
2. Add lime juice and rum: Add the fresh lime juice and white rum to the glass and stir until the sugar dissolves.
3. Fill with ice and top with club soda: Fill the glass with crushed ice and top it off with club soda, leaving some space for stirring.
4. Stir and garnish: Stir the cocktail gently to mix all the ingredients together. Garnish with a lime wedge and a sprig of fresh mint.
5. Enjoy: Sip and enjoy the refreshing flavors of the classic Mojito!

Feel free to adjust the amount of sugar and lime juice according to your taste preferences. Cheers!
