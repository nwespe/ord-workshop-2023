Recipe for Khachapuri


- 1 tbsp Dry active yeast
- 1.15 kg Flour
- 200 mL water 
- 200 mL whole milk
- 600 g Soft georgian cheese (or equivalent mass of 1x mozarella + 1.5x feta mixture, if at a pinch)
- 50 mL sunflower oil
- 30 g butter
- 2 Eggs
- 1 tsp Sugar

Dissolve sugar in 0.5 L warm water, add yeast and leave it for 15 minutes. 
Put flower in a large bowl and make a hole in the middle. Add yeast mixture, oil, milk and one egg. Mix it all up to a ball shape, cover and let rise for 2 hours.
Afterwards, add the rest of the flour and knead for a short while, split the dough in 3, knead to a ball shape, and cover. 
Grate the cheese in a bowl, add one egg and 20g butter, mix well. 
Flatten the dough ball into a circle and put the cheese in the middle. 
Close up the dough like a dumpling, turn it around and knead to flatten - make sure that the cheese is distributed evenly everywhere and that the dough stays intact!
Put the Khachapuri inside the preheated oven at 220 Â°C for 15 minutes. 
Brush the surface with the butter, let it rest for 5 minutes. 
Cut it up and enjoy!
