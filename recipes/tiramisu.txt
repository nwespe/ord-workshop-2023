Tiramisu

3-4 eggs (I take 4x53+)
250g mascarpone
60g sugar (this is the minimum otherwise it will be too unstable)
1 package of ladyfingers
2-3 cold espressos
some cocoa powder

Cream
1. Separate the eggs 
2. Beat the egg whites until stiff (store in the fridge)
3. Beat egg yolks with sugar until very creamy (until there is really no more color change)
4. Mix mascarpone into egg yolks
5. Gently fold in egg whites

Assembly
6. Dip ladyfingers with the non-sugar side in the coffee and then place them with the sugar side down in the mold
7. Line the mold and then spread the first half of the egg-mascarpone mixture on top 
8. Add another layer of coffee-dipped lady fingers and spread the second half of the egg-mascarpone mixture on top
9. Sift cocoa powder all over
10 Chill for at least 8h in the fridge
